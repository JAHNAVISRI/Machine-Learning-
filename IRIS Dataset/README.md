# Iris Dataset Classification

## Overview
This project involves the application of various machine learning algorithms on the Iris dataset to classify iris species. The following algorithms are implemented:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Naive Bayes
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of the following:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica
